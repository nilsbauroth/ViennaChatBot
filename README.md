# ViennaChatBot

Members: Nils Bauroth, Sigrid Huemer, Linus Schneider

Goal: creating a Telegram chatbot which lists you interesting points in Vienna near your location. Think of it like a “Vienna Service” Bot. You can list ViennaCityBikes near you or drinking fountains, public toilets etc

Used Data: It may be that we do not manage to include all the datasets, but those are the ones we are interested in:

- ViennaCityBikes
- Public Toilets
- Drinking Fountains
- Cool Streets
- Mistplätze

Tech Stack:

- Telegram Bot API
- Telegram BotFather
- JavaScript
- Node JS

Approach: We begin with using ViennaCityBike data and build our bot around this use case.
